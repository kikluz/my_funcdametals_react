Objectives
The first step in your journey towards the implementation of the Project Portfolio using React is to envision how you will evolve your project from the current Bootstrap implementation to a React implementation.

At the end of this step you should be able to:

Reflect on what you have developed so far using Bootstrap and what React will bring to your solution
Initialize your Portfolio Project using the create-react-app CLI
Plan for the transition of your current Bootstrap by listing the React Components you will need to develop
Assign ownership of the React Components across your Project Portfolio Team


Instructions
In this assignment, you will submit a written report describing how you will transition your Bootstrap project to a React project.

It is understood that you will not have a complete idea of React's capabilities at this point in your course. Make the best guess that you can with your understanding of React at this point, recognizing that the list of components and team responsibilities may evolve in the coming weeks.

Your report should contain answers to the following:



1. How your project will benefit from React
What are the main differences between Bootstrap and React?
What will React allow you to do that would have been difficult with Bootstrap?


2. Expected List of React Components

A brief list of the React Components you will need to develop for your application
Brief justifications for including these components

3. Team responsibilities
Which team member will own the development of which React Component?
