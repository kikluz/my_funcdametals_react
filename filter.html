		<h1>Advanced Array Methods: FILTERS</h1>
		 Learn to use the filter array method.

Instructions

The array method filter takes an array and a callback function that specifies a filtering condition, iterates through the array, and returns a new array that contains only the items that passed through the filter. 
In the developer console, enter the following:
const arr1 = [1, 3, 7, 4, 9, 15];
If you wanted to filter out only the items from this array that are less than 7, you could do this with a for loop or forEach.
With the filter method, you can do it in one line. Enter the following into your console:
const arr2 = arr1.filter(n => n < 7 );
arr1
arr2
You can see that arr1 still contains the old array, and arr2 now contains the new array, which is all the numbers from arr1 that are less than 7.
Like map, filter will iterate through every item in the array on which it was called, in this case, arr1.
At each iteration, it will assign that item to the value of the first parameter in a callback function, then check the filtering condition inside the function body, in this case, n < 7.
If the result is true, then it will place that item inside a new array. If the result is false, it will not.
At the end, when it has iterated through every item in the array on which it was called, it will return a new array composed of the items that passed the filtering condition. 
This is a major difference from the map method, which always returns an array that is of the same size as the original array.
Filter does not always return an array of the same size (though it can, if all items pass the filtering condition). 
For practice, enter this into your console - this time, we will be filtering using strings instead of numbers:
const animals = ['bear', 'panda', 'penguin', 'osprey'];
const filteredAnimals = animals.filter(animal => animal.includes('p'));
filteredAnimals
In this example, we are using filter to filter for every item in the animals array that includes the character 'p'. 
You should be able to see that the resulting filteredAnimals array includes all the items except 'bear'.
If you checked the value of the animals array at this point, it would be the same as it started with. Filter is also a non-mutator method. It creates a new array, but does not change the old array.

Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to use the array method filter, which like map, takes a callback function and returns a new array without mutating the original array. You learned that unlike map, however, filter does not always return an array of the same size as the original.
