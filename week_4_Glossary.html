Computed property names
Computed property names, new in ES6, are a way to create property name of objects dynamically using variables that are passed in.

Controlled Forms
Controlled forms are forms in which the fields of an HTML form are linked to and directly controlled by a React component, so that React is the single source of truth for the form state.

Flux
Flux is a design pattern/architecture that was created by the engineering team at Facebook as an alternative to MVC when working with React. There are many libraries which implement Flux, such as Flummox and Alt. Redux can be considered as an evolution/implementation of Flux. A key concept in Flux is that of unidirectional (one-way) data flow, which prevents inconsistencies and cascading effects.

Form Validation
JavaScript provides a way to validate form's data on the client's computer before sending it to the web server.

Basic Validation − First of all, the form must be checked to make sure all the mandatory fields are filled in. It would require just a loop through each field in the form and check for data.

Data Format Validation − Secondly, the data that is entered must be checked for correct form and value. Your code must include appropriate logic to test correctness of data.


M
MVC
The Model View Controller design pattern (or architectural pattern, or framework, depending on who you ask!) is one of the most widely used patterns for solving the problem of how to separate the View (UI) from the Model (application logic and data) on the front end. React was originally presented as the View part of MVC, but it has evolved since then and no longer considers MVC to be a part of its design.

Redux
Redux is a third-party JavaScript state management library that was created originally with React in mind, but is capable of working with any other JavaScript library or framework. It provides a consistent, predictable way to access and update the front-end application state. It is especially helpful when working with applications with many different components. It has three principles:

Single source of truth
State is read-only
Changes are made with pure functions

Regular Expressions
Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. 

The regular expressions syntax is not unique to JavaScript; it is supported across many programming languages, including Perl, Java, Python, C, and more. 

MDN - Regular expressions
S
Spread syntax
The spread syntax (...) is new in ES6 and provides an easy way to combine multiple objects, or to create a new object from an existing object while updating specific properties.

MDN - Spread syntax
T
Ternary Operator
The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, is typically used as a shorthand for the if statement. Ternary means "composed of three parts", and it is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands, as follows:

(condition to evaluate) ? (expression to execute if condition is truthy) : expression to indicate if condition is falsy

The parentheses around the condition to evaluate are not required, but often useful.

Toggling Modal
Modals are positioned over everything else in the document and remove scroll from the <body> so that modal content scrolls instead. Modals are unmounted when closed.

Uncontrolled Forms
Uncontrolled forms (or forms that are created using uncontrolled components) are forms in a React application where the form state is left to be controlled by the browser DOM, and the DOM is the single source of truth for the form state instead of React. React components will then use something called refs (innerRef in Reactstrap) in order to access the form state information.

Controlled forms (where React is the single source of truth for form state) is the recommended way to implement forms in React, but uncontrolled forms are sometimes more suitable.
