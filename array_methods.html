			<h1>Advanced Array Methods: MAPS</h1>

				<strong>

			</p>

			<p>
				The map method iterates through an array, performs a given callback function on every item in the array, and returns a new array at the end. 
				Open your console and enter the following
			</p>
<pre><code>
	const arr1 = [5, 21, 8, 100];
</code></pre>
			<p>
				Without using map, there are a couple different ways that we could iterate through this array and, for example, double each number. 
				Enter the following into your console:
			</p>
<pre><code>
	const arr2 = [];
	for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
		arr2[i] = arr1[i] * 2;
	}
	arr2
	const arr3 = [];
	arr1.forEach((n, i) => { arr3[i] = n * 2; });
	arr3
</code></pre>
			<p>
				The two approaches above reached the same goal.
				Now enter the following into your console:
			</p>
<pre><code>
	const arr4 = arr1.map(n => n * 2);
	arr4
</code></pre>
			<p>
				You can see how the map method also arrived at the same goal, but in a concise and elegant way.
				As its argument, it took an arrow function as its callback function (n => n * 2) which doubled every item in arr1 and returned the doubled value as an item in arr4.
			</p>
			<p>
				The variable name n is arbitrary and was chosen here to stand for number. 
				The map method will iterate on each element of the array on which it was called (in this case, arr1) and assign the value of the n to the current item in the array, perform the callback function (n * 2) then return the changed value to the new array arr4. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The map method will always return a new array that is the same size as the array on which it was called, and it will never change the array on which it was called - it is not a mutator method. 
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				Summary

				In this lesson, you learned how to use a map method, and its advantages over older forms of iterating such as for loops and forEach.
